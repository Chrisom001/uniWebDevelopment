		<h2>Week 11 – XSLT</h2>
		<p>When working to include external RSS feeds on the site, it was easy to get the XML data to copy to the page itself however, when it came to include the XSL and XSLT sections these were a little more difficult to get work however in the end they did start to function properly.</p>
		
		<p>This is extremely beneficial to the site as it allows for much easier access to the XML documents instead of using a number of other methods to try and be able to display the data through languages such as PHP. This is because the XSL stylesheet allows for the XML file to be modified directly much as CSS does to HTML. This means that there is less code needed to style what is usually, an unfriendly format for the novice to look at.

		<p>This also means that changes to the design of a webpage can be done extremely quickly if the data behind it isn’t changing, meaning updates or rewriting of code doesn’t have to be as costly. It uses XPath to identify the nodes within the XML documents which are the different elements which make up the XML file so that it can edit them effectively, rather than having to call them all individually.</p>
		
		<p>It also brings a wide number of benefits to developers as well, as it gives them the ability to their own user’s access to other RSS feeds from around the internet, but also to present them in a way that will keep them engaged instead of a standard list of information which is much less friendly.</p>
