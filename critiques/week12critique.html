		<h2>Week 12 - Rest API</h2>
		<p>For the FoxCo newsletter it was decided that the OpenWeatherMaps Rest API would be used to display the current weather data on the website. Rest API’s allow two resources to be able to communicate with each other and authenticate before passing information between them. This is done usually by having a dedicated API key which is added to the URL that’s used to get information for display.</p>
		
		<p>OpenWeatherMaps offers a wide variety of display options as part of their service which means that developers aren’t limited in what they can offer their users. An example of a URL is below which gets the current weather for Dundee, using the metric system along with the API Key.</p>
		<code>
		http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=2650752&APPID=944af91855a0dffe965b3d3c75066f7d&units=metric
		</code>

		<p>Before the API could be used an account needs to be created first which then creates the API key. However, with this service unlike others, it does take a couple of hours for it to activate. You can get the codes for individual cities by searching on the site, but you can also specify by cities in a zone, zip/postal code and geographic co-ordinates. </p>

		<p>One important element with things such as API keys is that they are kept secure from the general public. As a large number of these services do charge users if they get over a particular number of hits in a day/month/hour then if a key does leak into the public knowledge, it could cost the business hundreds if not thousands of pounds quite quickly. To prevent this, the key is kept behind PHP code which is run on the server’s side, so the client isn’t able to see anything that’s run within that section of code. Otherwise if it was visible, most users are technical enough to access that.</p>
