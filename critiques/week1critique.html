			<h4>1. At the heart of HTML5 frameworks is a grid system. Compare the grid systems for 2 frameworks. How do these frameworks support responsive web design.</h4>
			</br>
			<p>
				Bootstrap enables you to focus on responsive web design with grids as it automatically has flexbox built in which lets you make sites more responsive to size changes. This means you can focus on the actual website more than spending weeks working on the CSS allowing you to be much more efficient than writing everything from scratch.
			</p>
			<p>
				However looking at HTML Kickstart, in its grid functionality the responsiveness is an optional feature which you don’t have to implement. This means that you may need to change code depending on whether a site changes and without reading the documentation carefully you could construct a website that works well on a desktop browser but not on a mobile.

			</p>

		<div class="row">
		<h4>2. Menu systems are often a bind to get right especially if you want a multi-dropdown menu. In an ideal world you should write the HTML for a menu as a set of hierarchical un-numbered lists. Using this as your HTML, see how your chosen framework renders this. Critisise the implementation of Menus in your chosen HTML5 framework.</h4>
		</br>
		<p>
			One of my main criticisms of the menu system with Bootstrap is that it only appears to have a set number of colours available which means that you will need to base the rest of the site around this if you’re using the nav bars. This can make it a bit more restrictive than if the code was being created from scratch or other potential frameworks.
		</p>
		<p>
			It also has a lot of options when it comes to creating the navbar which could confuse a lot of newer developers especially if they aren’t sure what they’re looking for from a menu/navbar. This means that when they design it, it could be ineffective because of the way it’s been laid out simply because there are so many options. This however can be a benefit to an experienced developer as they will be able to make good use of these features.
		</p>

		<div class="row">
		<h4>3.Pick out 5 features, other than grid and menu, that your chosen framework supports and comment on their usefulness.</h4>
		</br>
		<p>
			Pagination – Pagination is a feature within bootstrap which is extremely useful as it allows you to take large datasets and split them up into more manageable “chunks”. This is especially useful for a user because they don’t have to potentially scroll down a huge list of items or not be able to view anything past the initial ones displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alerts – Alerts can be exceptionally useful as it can display when something either goes wrong or is successful to the user. Normally it can be harder to code these especially if you want to use colour, however this functionality is built in to bootstrap making it easier to implement and eye catching for the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			Breadcrumb – This is a good method of moving between pages or showing a user where they are in relation to the main page. This can help them if they want to move back just a single page from where they started. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Dropdowns – These are especially useful for mobile devices as you can use them to condense what may have been a wide list into one that is more easily displayable for smaller screens. It also has the ability to have a split button and dropdown which can give you a default action with the dropdown acting as secondary ones. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Tooltips – If you have a function on the website which perhaps some people may not understand fully or a section they must fill in which may require more information, you can use the tooltip to explain it to them in more detail without having to take up further space on the screen normally. This can help to condense websites meaning there’s less potentially unnecessary information to distract or annoy users.
