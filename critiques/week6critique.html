		<h2>Week 6 - Frameworks</h2>
		<p>A PHP Framework is a scaffolding which can be used as the basis for a website. This allows a developer to be able to start building a site quickly rather than having to build everything that they need from the ground up as a number of functions will already be pre-built within them. This can also mean that code is also cleaner and less repetitive as frameworks are designed to be a solution to general problems which the designers identified. </p>
		
		<p>Frameworks also allow a site to be more secure from the initial point as they will have a level of security built into them from the beginning. This means that the programmer using the framework won’t have to put as much thought into that, especially at the end of development which can take more time than if it was done at the start.</p>
		
		<p>A good example of these features is with the cakePHP framework which on it’s website states that it has “Translations, database access, caching, validation, authentication, and much more” (cakePHP, 2018) as part of the framework itself. This if developed from scratch could take a significant amount of time. </p>
		
		<p>It almost mentions that it follows MVC conventions which means that it will make it easier for developers to follow this, allowing for greater security for the database as it’s access will be separate to that of the view, but also help keep code cleaner and easier to maintain.</p>

		<p>While there are positives, there are some drawbacks that need to be reviewed as well, such as due to these being opensource programs usually, it means that for a website you are reliant on an outside source. This means that in the future this framework could change something that could break a site that was developed on it. While this can be mitigated if a developer uses a popular framework, it doesn’t provide any guarantees.</p>

		<p>Another potential issue is that the developer may not be able to see any of the core code for the program or be able to change this as it’s owned by this outside source. This means that if a large amount of change is required to make it suitable for a particular project, it may mean that a developer will need to look elsewhere.</p>
