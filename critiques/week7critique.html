		<h2>Week 7 - Internet of Things</h2>
		<p>The task with the electric imp was an extremely difficult one to begin. Due to the nature of the device and requiring such precision when trying to blink it to upload settings it was difficult to get the device to sync up to the internet. </p>
		
		<p>Due to the room that this task was completed within, it was necessary to create a wifi-hotspot using a mobile phone to get a definite connection to the internet that the device could connect with.
		Once the device was connected, it was easy to follow the guide provided to be able to get the sensors to connect and begin to display the data for the temperature on the screen. Due to the code setting it to take readings every 20 seconds it was clear when a new reading was taken on screen. It was also easy to stop the device from doing this to be able to add additional code to take light and voltage readings as well.</p>
		
		<p>Overall this task, once the initial technical hurdles were overcome was quite easy to do as the electric imp made coding for it extremely easy and quick to pick up. It was clearly designed for new developers to be able to use. This is a positive thing as it is a good example of the Internet of Things which is going to be a major part of the future.</p>
