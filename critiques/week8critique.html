		<h2>Week 8 - Internet of Things (Week 2)</h2>
		<p>When looking at the data that the electric imp needed to store it was decided that a JSON string would be easier to hold the data in the database. This is because the json string can be easily decoded and displayed on the website and will require less space within the database itself.</p>
		
		<p>Along with the Json sting which held the Internal and External temperatures, voltage and light levels it was also stored with a unique ID number for each reading as well as the date and time, and device used to capture this. </p>
		
		<p>This method was chosen over a relational database as it wasn’t necessary to have an individual field for every reading there. This is because when passing information from the ElectricImp there is no feedback about what’s happening between the PHP and Electricimp except some extremely basic information. In this case, when passing fewer variables between the two, it meant there was a greater chance for success, and as the json string can hold a lot of information within a single variable.</p>

		<p>This also means when reading from the database it should be quicker, especially in an environment where there is a lot of data needing to be passed back and forth. If a user has 100 devices all feeding information into the database, you could use a single table, with each column holding a single devices reading. Due to this, if the data is needing to be accessed, fewer columns need to be referenced allowing for a faster read time which in a larger environment could be critical.</p>
